# Vue Dynamic Table

A table front-end plugin for your api with support to all CRUD operations.

This Vue.js plugin allows you to quickly set up a front-end interface with which to interact with your models through an API. It provides:

<ul>
  <li>Custom columns</li>
  <li>Pagination</li>
  <li>Sorting</li>
  <li>Search</li>
  <li>Arbitrary filtering</li>
  <li>Sidenavbar for more filters or random stuff</li>
  <li>Custom rules for filter x filter and filter x search interaction</li>
  <li>Deleting and activating/deactivating functionality per row</li>
  <li>DynamicForm for adding records</li>
  <li>DynamicForm for reading and editing records</li>
</ul>

Depending on your needs, it is entirely possible that VueDynamicTable, plus an extra navbar, offers the whole frontend that you need for your application.
